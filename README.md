# Weather-App
Fun weather application build using AngularFire2, Ionic 3 and Angular 4
Short and Sweet weather application built using the Angular4 and Ionic Framework. There may be some issues! But I am still a noobie. Below there are some snapshots of the app on Android and IOS.

# WhoAmIApp
Small application built using the same technologies as the weather application. Built to learn and become familiar AngularFire2 and Firebase functionality. Still a work in progress.
